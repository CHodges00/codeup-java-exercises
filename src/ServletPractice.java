//    A servlet is a Java class that extends the HttpServlet class from the servlet library.
//    A servlet's most basic functionality is to handle HTTP requests and responses.
//    Servlets also allow us to create dynamic web pages with Java;
//    that is, we can create HTML responses where the content changes based on variables, not just static HTML pages.
